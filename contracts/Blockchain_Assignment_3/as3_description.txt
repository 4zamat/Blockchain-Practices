Task 1

Write a contract that contains one function

This function takes two integer arguments number1, number2
and returns the one that is greater
If the numbers are equal, return either of them

Task 2

Write a contract that contains one function

This function takes one argument - some number
Returns true if this number is even
and false if it is not even

Task 3

Write a contract that contains one function

This function takes three integer arguments a, b and c
and returns true if
a is either greater than b and c
or if a is greater than c and less than b
otherwise, the function returns false

Task 4

Write a contract that contains one function

This function takes one value - some number, calculates and returns its factorial

Factorial is the product of all numbers from some number n to 1 inclusive

For example, the factorial of the number 5:

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Task 5

Write a contract that contains one function

This function helps calculate the profit from a bank deposit
It takes three values - the initial deposit amount, the interest rate, and the number of months for which the deposit is made

The function returns the deposit amount after months

This tariff uses compound interest - at the end of each month, an amount equal to the rate of interest on the current deposit amount is added to the deposit

Task 6

Write a contract that contains one function

This function takes three integer arguments number1, number2, and operation

If the operation value is 1, the function returns the sum of number1 and number2

If the operation value is 2, the function returns the difference of number1 and number2

If the operation value is 3, the function returns the multiplication of number1 and number2

If the operation value is 4, the function returns the ratio of number1 and number2

Task 7

Write a contract that contains one function

This function takes a number as an argument and returns a Boolean value
true - if it is a prime number
false - if it is not a prime number

A prime number is one that is divisible only by 1 and itself

Problem 8

Write a contract that contains one function

This function takes one value - the number n and returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci series

Problem 9

Write a contract that contains one function

This function takes two arguments, the numbers number1 and number2
The function returns the greatest common divisor of these two numbers

hint: the Euclidean algorithm will help you find the greatest common divisor
