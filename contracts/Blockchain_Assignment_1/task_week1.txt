Task 1

Write a contract with one state variable text of type string.

The contract should also contain two functions:

A function to update the value of text with a new string argument.

A function with the view access modifier to return the current value of text.



---

Task 2

Write a contract with two state variables:

A boolean variable flag.

An unsigned 128-bit integer counter.


The contract should also contain the following five functions:

1. A function to toggle the value of flag (true -> false or false -> true).


2. A function to reset counter to zero.


3. A function to increment counter by a given value.


4. A function to decrement counter by a given value.


5. A view function to return the current values of flag and counter.




---

Task 3

Write a contract that acts as a simple bank system with:

A state variable balance of type uint256.


The contract should include six functions:

1. A function to deposit funds (add to the balance).


2. A function to withdraw funds (subtract from the balance).


3. A function to check the current balance (view function).


4. A function to double the balance.


5. A function to reset the balance to zero.


6. A function to transfer the balance to another contract address (requires address input).




---

Task 4

Write a contract with the following properties:

Two variables a and b of type int64.

A function to set the values of a and b.

Four separate functions to:

1. Swap the values of a and b.


2. Return the larger of a and b.


3. Return the smaller of a and b.


4. Check if a and b are equal, returning true or false.





---

Task 5

Write a contract to manage a leaderboard system with:

A mapping scores that stores player addresses as keys and their scores (uint16) as values.


The contract should include the following functionality:

1. A function to set a player’s score.


2. A function to retrieve a player’s score.


3. A function to reset a player’s score.


4. A function to calculate the total score of all players.


5. A function to determine the player with the highest score.
